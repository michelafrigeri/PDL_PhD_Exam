* 'Install required packages.ipynb' is a jupyter notebook file containing the necessary code lines for the installation of packages needed for the main script.
* 'PM10_model.ipynb' is a jupyter notebook file containing the central body of the project. This notebook will be used for the presentation on Wed 10/01/2024.
* 'Py_Dataset.csv' and 'Stazioni_Emilia.csv' are the two data.frame needed for running the code. In this project is provided a Bayesian data analysis of PM10 air pollution; the analysis is carried out on these data from ARPA Emilia-Romagna.
* 'fourier.stan' and 'spatial_fourier.stan' are two .stan scripts (that can be retrieved as an output running the python code). These scrips are needed to provide MCMC sampling in the Bayesian modeling framework.
